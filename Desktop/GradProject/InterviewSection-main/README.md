## Recent Changes (AI Assistant Session)

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **Microphone Permission (iOS):**
  - Ensured `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` are present in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
  - Updated `ios/Podfile` to add the `PERMISSION_MICROPHONE=1` preprocessor definition for proper permission handling with `permission_handler`.
  - Ran `pod install` and cleaned/rebuilt the project to apply changes.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Speed:**
  - Lowered the TTS speech rate in `lib/screens/interview_screen.dart` for a more natural voice experience.
- **API Key Management:**
  - Updated both `lib/services/api_service.dart` and `lib/services/fixed_api_service.dart` to use a new, valid OpenRouter API key for dynamic question generation and answer evaluation.
  - Provided instructions for users to obtain and securely set their own API key.
- **API Integration:**
  - Verified OpenRouter API status and ensured the app now generates unique, relevant interview questions from the API.
- **General:**
  - Cleaned and rebuilt the project to ensure all changes are applied.

Replace the value of `_apiKey` with your own key from https://openrouter.ai/
